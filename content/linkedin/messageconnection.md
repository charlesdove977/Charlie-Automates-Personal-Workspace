# LinkedIn Message Connection

Context document for LinkedIn warm outreach strategy. Updated as patterns emerge.

---

## Chrome Shortcut

**Command:** `/message-connection`

Use this shortcut in Claude-in-Chrome to execute the messaging workflow.

---

## Strategy Overview

**Goal:** Warm connection via DM → Add value through conversation → Convert through content (not direct pitching)

**Why This Works:**
- DM spam is rampant, so genuine conversation stands out
- Building a pool of people who actually see and engage with posts
- When offers are posted, warm connections are primed to respond
- No rejection risk - never pitching directly in DMs

**Volume Target:** ~100 outreach attempts, then refine framework based on what worked

---

## Target Segments

### 1. Business Owners / Operators
- **What they care about:** Efficiency, margins, scale without more headcount
- **Charles's value:** AI that saves time/money on ops they hate
- **Angle:** Talk business problems, not tech

### 2. Agency Owners
- **What they care about:** Delivery capacity, client results, margins
- **Charles's value:** AI to fulfill faster or offer new services
- **Angle:** Peer-level conversation, not being sold to

### 3. AI Beginners
- **What they care about:** Overwhelm, where to start, not getting left behind
- **Charles's value:** Clarity, simple wins, guidance
- **Angle:** Be a guide, not a guru flexing

## Prospect Filtering

### Reach Out (Strong Fit)
- Headline shows: agency owner, consultant, company owner, CEO, founder
- "I help X do Y" positioning
- Running a service business
- In the AI/automation space (peer/collaborator)
- Clearly building or selling something

### Worth a Shot
- Independent/freelance with business signal
- Product-focused but clearly running operations
- Vague headline but some business context

### Skip
- Appears under 25 (looking for established operators, not early career)
- Employees (unless ops/leadership with influence)
- Teachers, job seekers, students
- Vague inspirational headlines ("Dreamer | Visionary | Coffee lover")
- No business signal at all
- VC/investor (unless direct relevance)

### Tier System for Engagement Type
- **Tier 1: Commenters** - Higher signal, easier to personalize, prioritize these
- **Tier 2: Likers with strong profiles** - Lower signal, profile-based opener
- **Tier 3: Cold connections** - Need strong profile match to justify outreach

---

## Opener Guidelines

### Tone
- Warm and human
- Show genuine interest in them
- Position Charles as expert but humble
- No pitching, no selling
- Goal: Start a conversation about their business

### Structure
- Start with "Hey [Name], great to connect" or "good to be connected"
- Reference something specific about their business/role
- Ask an open question about their work or challenges
- Keep it short (2-3 sentences max)

### Avoid
- "Hey I noticed..." or "Saw you're..." (sounds stalker-ish)
- Generic compliments
- Anything that sounds templated
- Pitching services
- Long paragraphs

### Good Opener Examples

**For Agency/Consulting Owners:**
> Hey Kerry, great to connect. Always curious how design agency owners are thinking about scaling without burning out the team. What's been your biggest challenge lately?

**For Service Business Owners:**
> Hey Jack, great to connect. NYC property compliance is no joke - how's business going? Curious how you're handling the lead flow side of things.

**For AI/Automation Peers:**
> Hey Abdullah, good to be connected. Always cool to meet others in the automation/voice agent space. What's got your attention right now?

**For Productized Service:**
> Hey Umar, good to connect. The inbox/calendar management angle for CEOs is smart. How's that going for you?

**For Vague but Promising:**
> Hey Marcus, glad to be connected. Are you running your own furniture operation? Would love to hear more about what you do.

## Content Conversion Strategy

*How to convert warm connections through posts*

- Once DM relationship is warm, they'll see your posts
- Posts with case studies, results, and soft CTAs
- "DM me [KEYWORD]" lets warm connections self-select
- Never pitch in DM - let content do the selling
