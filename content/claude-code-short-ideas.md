## Idea 1: Personal AGI To-Do List

**Hook:** "It's insane how many people even in the AI space don't see how close Claude Code is coming to being your own little personal AGI"

**Contrast:**
- A (Common): Most people use a to-do list and manually check things off
- B (Reality): To-do list synced to Claude Code that completes tasks autonomously and texts you when done

**Technical Setup:**
- Claude Agents SDK running 24/7
- Telegram MCP for text communication
- MCPs: GitHub, Notion, Google Drive, Calendar, Email, Social Media, Skool

**Key Visual:** Phone notification showing task completed / to-do items checking themselves off

**Proof Points:**
- Morning news summaries from social feeds
- Calendar briefing
- Next tasks prioritized
- Tasks completed without human intervention

**Pattern Used:**
1. Bold FOMO claim ("even AI people don't see...")
2. Personal proof ("for me, I literally...")
3. Common behavior contrast
4. Technical reveal
5. Lifestyle result
6. CTA
