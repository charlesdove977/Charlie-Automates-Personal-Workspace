## Script

It's insane how many people even in the AI space don't see how close Claude Code is coming to being your own little personal AGI.

At this point for me, I literally have Claude Code completing tasks for me like it's my personal assistant throughout the day triggered from my phone.

Most people still use a to-do list on their phone and check off things as they complete it throughout the day, where instead I have my to-do list synced up with Claude Code so it can read my to-do list file, evaluate whether it can complete the task for me, and if it can, it does it and it sends me a text message when it's done.

This is accomplished by using an instance of Claude Agents SDK, which is running 24/7 on my computer, combined with the Telegram MCP, which allows me to text it back and forth.

It has MCP integrations with all the different apps that I use on a daily basis — GoHighLevel, Google Drive, Calendar, Gmail, all my social media profiles, my Skool community, and many more.

It gives me comprehensive news summaries from all my social media feeds in the morning every day, tells me what's on my calendar, and tells me the next tasks that need to be accomplished.
