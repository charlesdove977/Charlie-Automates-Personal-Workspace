**Topic:** How the Ralph agent system uses fresh context windows to avoid degradation
**Format:** Educational explainer (60-90 seconds)
**Target:** Claude Code users, AI automation enthusiasts

## SCRIPT

### HOOK (0-5 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Screen recording showing Twitter/X feed with Ralph memes scrolling by, or split screen of multiple people talking about it]**

> "If you've touched Claude Code this week, you've seen everyone losing their minds over this Ralph agent system."

---

### CURIOSITY GAP (5-10 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Quick cut to you, confused face, then graphic showing "FORGET EVERYTHING" with a question mark]**

> "But here's what's weird - the whole thing works by making your AI forget everything. How does that make sense?"

---

### TRANSITION
**[VISUAL: Cut to screen share or diagram view]**

> "Here's the breakdown."

---

### STEP 1: INPUT (10-18 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Show a prompt being typed, or a simple flowchart starting with "YOUR IDEA"]**

> "You start with an idea - just a prompt describing what you want to build. Claude Code takes that and turns it into a PRD - a product requirements doc that lists out every feature."

---

### STEP 2: TASK BREAKDOWN (18-25 seconds)
**[VISUAL: PRD document splitting into smaller task cards, animated]**

> "Then it breaks each feature into small, specific tasks. One thing at a time. Now - this part isn't revolutionary. Lots of systems do task breakdown."

---

### DIFFERENTIATION (25-35 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Highlight or zoom on "NEW SESSION" - show context window visual emptying out and refilling fresh]**

> "What makes Ralph different is when it executes each task, it spins up a completely fresh session. Brand new context window. Clean slate."

---

### THE WHY (35-45 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison - "Old Context" (cluttered, degraded) vs "Fresh Context" (clean, sharp). Maybe show quality degrading over time on left side]**

> "Why? Because the longer you use any AI in the same conversation, the worse it gets. That's called context rot. Fresh tokens, fresh quality."

---

### THE LOOP (45-60 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Flowchart showing: Task → Attempt → Pass/Fail → Notes → New Session (loop back). Animate the loop cycling]**

> "After each attempt - pass or fail - it writes notes. What worked, what didn't. If it fails, it starts over with a fresh context BUT it brings those notes in. It keeps trying - up to ten times - until it either nails it or moves on."

---

### PRINCIPLE CALLBACK (60-70 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Zoom out to show "CONTEXT MANAGEMENT" as the big concept, with Ralph as one example underneath it]**

> "This is really just smart context management. Same principle showing up everywhere in AI right now."

---

### CLOSER (70-80 seconds)
**[VISUAL: Return to you, or overlay text reinforcing the key insight]**

> "Fresh context for every task, learning from each attempt. That's why this system is getting so much attention."

## KEY VISUALS CHECKLIST

- [ ] Twitter/social feed showing Ralph hype
- [ ] "Forget Everything" graphic with question mark
- [ ] Flowchart: Idea → PRD → Tasks
- [ ] "NEW SESSION" highlight animation
- [ ] Context rot visual (degraded vs fresh comparison)
- [ ] Retry loop flowchart (Task → Attempt → Notes → New Session)
- [ ] "Context Management" concept zoom-out
- [ ] Text overlays for key terms: PRD, Context Rot, Fresh Tokens

---

## HOOK OPTIONS (A/B test)

**Option A (Social proof):**
> "Everyone in Claude Code is talking about Ralph this week..."

**Option B (Contrarian):**
> "The hottest AI agent right now works by forgetting everything. Here's why that's genius."

**Option C (Direct challenge):**
> "Your AI gets dumber the longer you talk to it. This system fixes that."

---

## NOTES

- Keep energy up but not hype-y
- Lean into the "wait, that's backwards" moment
- The visual of context degrading vs staying fresh is the money shot
- End on principle, not just the tool - makes it evergreen
