# GSD Plugin - Short Script

**Format:** YouTube Short (35-40s)
**Topic:** Get Shit Done plugin for Claude Code

---

## HOOK (0-5s)
*[Screen: Claude response that's clearly degraded or off-topic]*

"If you're using Claude for big projects and the quality gets worse the longer you go - that's not Claude's fault. That's yours."

---

## THE PROBLEM (5-10s)
*[Screen: You talking or context bar filling up]*

"Claude has a context window. The longer you go, the more it fills up. That's context rot - and it kills big builds."

---

## THE FIX (10-30s)
*[Screen: Show .planning/ folder, then /gsd commands running]*

"The fix - Get Shit Done. It's an orchestration layer on top of Claude Code. Perfect if you're at the idea stage trying to build a full app."

*[Quick flash: PROJECT.md → ROADMAP.md → PLAN.md]*

"It breaks your project into phases, splits tasks down to the smallest steps, then sends fresh sub-agents to execute each one. Full context every time - no rot."

---

## THE ASSERTION (30-35s)
*[Screen: Clean commit history or back to face]*

"Big projects don't fail because Claude isn't smart enough. They fail because you didn't give it guardrails."

---

## CTA (35-40s)
*[Screen: Terminal or link]*

"Link in bio."

## Visual Ideas

1. **Degraded response**: Show a real or mocked Claude response gone off the rails
2. **Context bar**: Visual of context filling up, turning red
3. **Folder flash**: .planning/ folder with PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md
4. **Command flash**: /gsd:new-project or /gsd:execute-plan running
5. **Sub-agent visual**: Show Claude spawning fresh agents for each task
6. **Commit history**: Clean atomic commits from a real GSD build
7. **Terminal install**: `npx get-shit-done-cc --global`

---

## Key Points

- **Assertive tone** - "That's yours" puts responsibility on viewer
- **Orchestration layer** - frames GSD as a control system, not just a plugin
- **Idea stage** - speaks to people who have an app idea but don't know how to build it
- **Sub-agents** - the fresh context magic that prevents rot
- **Guardrails** - memorable closer
