# Ralph Whim Agent Instagram Reel
**30-Second Explainer**

Target: Claude Code users who want to understand what Ralph Whim does

Hook Type: Curiosity + Pattern interrupt ("Everyone's going nuts")

Duration: 30-35 seconds

## FULL TRANSCRIPT (VERIFIED)

"Everyone's going nuts in the Claude code community about this Ralph Whim agent. So here's how it works in 30 seconds.

First, you show up to Claude code with an idea of what you want to build and it's going to create a PRD, which is a product requirements document.

It then converts that PRD to Ralph format, that just means it goes into JSON format and it breaks down features into specific tasks.

From there, it's going to run Ralph and all that means is it's going to open up a new session window and it's going to try to complete it one task at a time.

And if it doesn't complete the task, it's going to add some notes about what went wrong. It's going to start another session and repeat that process again up to 10 times for each task.

So that's all it is. It's an elegant way to take your idea, break it down into tasks, while also fighting context rot along the way when you're trying to actually build it."

## VISUAL STYLE OPTIONS

### OPTION 1: Talking Head + Screen Recording
- 0-3s: You on camera (hook)
- 3-28s: Screen recordings with voiceover
- 28-35s: Back to you (closer)

### OPTION 2: Split Screen
- You on left (small circle)
- Screen recording on right (main)
- Keep both visible entire time

### OPTION 3: Full Screen Recording + Text
- No face to camera
- Pure screen recording
- Heavy text overlays to guide attention

**RECOMMENDED: OPTION 1** (strongest for IG Reels algorithm - face time matters)

## B-ROLL / SCREEN RECORDING NEEDS

**Must Capture:**
1. ✅ Claude Code interface with an idea being typed
2. ✅ PRD being generated (show the document structure)
3. ✅ JSON conversion happening
4. ✅ New session window opening
5. ✅ Task being executed
6. ✅ Error/retry mechanism (if possible to demo)
7. ✅ Final completed task

**If you can't screen record all of this:**
- Use simple animations
- Show diagrams (flowchart style)
- Use text-based visualizations

## HOOK ANALYSIS

**Current Hook:**
"Everyone's going nuts in the Claude code community about this Ralph Whim agent."

**Why it Works:**
✅ Social proof ("everyone's going nuts")
✅ Creates FOMO (what am I missing?)
✅ Specific community callout (Claude Code users)
✅ Named the thing (Ralph Whim agent)
✅ Promise of quick explanation ("30 seconds")

**Pattern Interrupt:**
The energy + "going nuts" stops the scroll

## CAPTION FOR IG POST

```
Ralph Whim agent explained in 30 seconds 🔥

The Claude Code community is going crazy over this, and for good reason.

Here's what it does:
→ Takes your idea
→ Creates a PRD
→ Breaks it into tasks
→ Executes each task in fresh sessions
→ Auto-retries up to 10x if something fails

The killer feature? It fights context rot.

Each task gets a clean session. No degraded quality. No context limit issues.

This is how you go from idea to working product without the usual Claude Code frustrations.
