## Full Script

### HOOK [0:00-0:12]
*Look directly at camera. Calm, reflective tone - not dramatic.*

> "People know me as the AI automation guy. But there's a version of me most people don't see - a 12-year-old kid who started bodybuilding because he was tired of being a target. 16 years in the gym shaped how I build everything."

---

### VISUAL BRIDGE [0:12-0:15]
*Cut to photos while speaking:*

**[IMG_9158 - group gym shot, 1 second]**
**[IMG_9155 - camo shorts peak shot, 1.5 seconds]**

> "And it taught me 5 things about business I didn't expect."

---

### LESSON 1: DISCIPLINE [0:15-0:35]
*Back to talking head*

> "First - discipline. But not the way people talk about it. In the gym, discipline is simple. Show up, lift, do your cardio, eat, repeat. Business isn't like that. There's ambiguity. You don't always know what to do next. The discipline isn't just showing up - it's showing up and thinking clearly when nothing is clear."

---

### LESSON 2: STRUCTURE [0:35-0:55]
*Steady, building energy*

> "Second - structure. Bodybuilding forced me to plan. Meal prep, training splits, recovery. You can't wing it and expect results. Business is the same. Your calendar, your follow-ups, your projects - if you're not structuring your days, you're just reacting. And reacting doesn't build anything lasting."

---

### LESSON 3: APPEARANCE [0:55-1:15]
*Slight lean in, more direct*

> "Third - appearance matters. When you're in shape, people assume you're disciplined before you say a word. That's just how it works. And I started thinking - how does my business look before I say a word? My website, my social media, my sales calls. First impressions are being made whether I'm there or not."

---

### LESSON 4: COMMUNITY [1:15-1:35]
*Warmer, more personal tone*

> "Fourth - and this one surprised me - you can't do it alone. Bodybuilding feels like a solo sport. Just you and the weights. But I never made real progress without spotters, training partners, people who pushed me when I didn't feel like showing up. Business is the same. Surround yourself with people who make you better. It's not optional."

---

### LESSON 5: THE CONTRADICTION [1:35-1:55]
*Pause slightly before this one. Let it land. This is "The Last Dab."*

> "And fifth... appearances aren't everything."

*Brief pause - 1 second*

> "I know - I just said they matter. But here's the thing. You can't build a life on looks. At some point, you need depth. Your skills, your character, how you treat people. Working out to look good isn't the same as working out to live well. And building a business to chase money isn't the same as building one that actually gives value. The second one lasts."

---

### CLOSE [1:55-2:10]
*Direct eye contact, genuine invitation - not salesy*

> "These lessons took me 16 years to learn. I'm building a community of people figuring this out together - agency owners, entrepreneurs, people who want to build something real. If that sounds like you, I'd love to have you. Link's in my bio."

## Delivery Notes

- **Don't rush lessons 1-4.** Let them breathe.
- **The pause before "appearances aren't everything" is crucial.** It signals the flip is coming.
- **Slow down on the close.** "I'd love to have you" should feel like you mean it.
- **Look at the camera like you're talking to one person**, not an audience.
- **Don't over-edit.** Let some imperfection stay - it builds authenticity.
- **End looking directly into camera** for the close.

## Why This Works

**Hook Psychology:**
- "People know me as..." acknowledges what audience might already think
- "A version most people don't see" creates intimacy - they're getting access
- "Tired of being a target" is visceral without being dramatic
- No victim energy - shows agency ("I started bodybuilding")

**Structure Psychology:**
- Lessons 1-4 build credibility and relatability
- Lesson 5 (the contradiction) is the "Last Dab" - the memorable payoff
- Close invites rather than pitches - "figuring this out together" = peer, not guru

**Photo Strategy:**
- Maximum contrast (skinny → peak) proves the 16 years
- Group gym shot supports "community" lesson authentically
- Professional peak shot establishes credibility without bragging
