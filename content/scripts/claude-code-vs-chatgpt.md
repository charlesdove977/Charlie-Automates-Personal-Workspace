# Script: Why I Switched From ChatGPT to Claude Code

## Format
Short-form vertical (60-90 seconds)

## Hook
"Most people use ChatGPT to help them code, but I'm gonna challenge that belief… if you're someone who wants to actually build things without being a developer, you should really be looking at Claude Code."

## Body

"Now look, I've used both for months…"

"But Claude Code is just a better tool for people who want to build, not babysit."

"ChatGPT is great if you just need quick code snippets or you want to learn concepts."

"But if you're trying to actually build something - an app, a tool, an automation - ChatGPT turns into a copy-paste nightmare."

"You're jumping between browser tabs, pasting code into files, debugging errors manually, losing context every conversation."

"Claude Code runs in your terminal. It reads your files, writes your files, and actually implements changes for you."

"You describe what you want, it builds it. No copy-paste. No tab switching. No babysitting."

"That difference alone makes it the better tool if you actually want to ship something."

## CTA
"So if you're serious about building, start looking into Claude Code."

## Production Notes

### Key Visual Moments
1. **Hook**: Face to camera, confident
2. **"copy-paste nightmare"**: Quick cuts showing ChatGPT → copy → paste → error → repeat
3. **"runs in your terminal"**: Screen recording of Claude Code in action
4. **"describe what you want, it builds it"**: Show a prompt → show the result

### Contrast Table (for B-roll text overlays)

| ChatGPT | Claude Code |
|---------|-------------|
| Copy-paste workflow | Builds directly |
| Context resets | Knows your project |
| You implement | It implements |
| Browser tabs | One terminal |

### Proof Element
- Show a real example: describe something → Claude Code builds it
- Could use Reel Recon or a simple demo build
