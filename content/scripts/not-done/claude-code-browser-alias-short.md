**Duration:** ~80 seconds
**Format:** Vertical short / Reel
**Hook:** The Direct Secret
**Status:** Not Done

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:07)

**[VISUAL: Terminal open, cursor blinking]**

"If you're using Claude Code, you need this alias. One line, and it boots with browser control automatically. Let me show you."

---

## SETUP: THE ALIAS (0:07 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL: Opening shell config file - .zshrc or .bashrc]**

"Open your terminal config. Add this line."

**[VISUAL: Typing or pasting the alias command]**

"This creates an alias that launches Claude Code with dangerous permissions enabled AND auto-connects to the Chrome extension. No prompts. No extra flags. Just type your alias and go."

**[VISUAL: Save file, source it]**

"Save. Source it. Done."

---

## SETUP: CHROME EXTENSION (0:30 - 0:50)

**[VISUAL: Chrome web store, Claude extension]**

"Now grab the Claude Chrome extension. Install it. That's literally it."

**[VISUAL: Extension icon in Chrome toolbar]**

"Claude Code can now see and control your browser."

---

## DEMO: PROOF (0:50 - 1:15)

**[VISUAL: Terminal - typing the alias, Claude boots]**

"Watch. I type my alias..."

**[VISUAL: Browser opens, Claude navigating to LinkedIn]**

"Claude connects to Chrome, opens LinkedIn, and..."

**[VISUAL: Claude responding to a comment on your post]**

"...starts answering comments on my post. In my voice. While I do literally anything else."

**[VISUAL: Multiple comments getting responses]**

"This runs in the background. No babysitting."

---

## CTA (1:15 - 1:22)

**[VISUAL: Back to you / terminal]**

"One alias. Full browser control. Go set it up."

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

- Have alias command ready as text overlay for viewers to screenshot
- Record LinkedIn demo in advance as backup
- Keep terminal text large enough to read on mobile
- Consider adding the actual alias syntax as a pinned comment

---

## ALIAS SYNTAX (for reference)

```bash
alias cc="claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

*(Verify exact flags before recording - Chrome extension connects automatically when installed)*
