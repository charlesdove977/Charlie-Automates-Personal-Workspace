# Claude Workspace Setup - Short Script

**Format:** YouTube Short (60s)
**Sequel to:** CLAUDE.md video

---

## HOOK (0-5s)
*[Screen: You opening a random new folder, empty]*

"If you're using Claude and you're opening a new folder for every project - you're starting from zero every single time."

---

## DELIVERABLE FLASH (5-10s)
*[Screen: Cut to Charlieautomates folder structure - quick zoom through apps/, .claude/, agents/ - make it look like a command center]*

"This is my Claude workspace. One folder. Every project I build lives here. And Claude remembers everything."

---

## THE DIFFERENCE (10-25s)
*[Split screen or quick cuts]*

*[Left: empty folder with cursor blinking]*
"New folder every project? Claude has no idea who you are. No idea what you're building. No memory."

*[Right: Charlieautomates with CLAUDE.md visible]*
"One workspace? Claude knows my business, my tech stack, my preferences. Every. Single. Time."

---

## THE STRUCTURE (25-45s)
*[Screen recording: clicking through folders]*

"Here's how it works. Everything lives under one folder."

*[Highlight .claude/CLAUDE.md]*
"CLAUDE.md - this is my context. My business, my goals, how I like to build. Claude reads this automatically."

*[Highlight apps/ folder]*
"Apps folder - every new project goes here. Isolated, but still inside my workspace."

*[Highlight .claude/commands/ or agents/]*
"Shared commands and templates - I build once, use everywhere."

---

## THE ASSERTION (45-55s)
*[Back to face or screen with full folder view]*

"Could you use separate folders for each project? Sure. Some people do. But then you're managing ten different setups, ten different contexts, ten different versions of 'how you work.'"

"I want one home base. One Claude that knows me. That's the difference."

---

## CTA (55-60s)
*[Screen: maybe show CLAUDE.md file or your YouTube channel]*

"I'll show you how to set this up - link's in the bio."

---

## Visual Ideas

1. **Contrast shot**: Empty folder vs your full workspace (split screen or quick cut)
2. **Command center energy**: Fast zoom through your folder structure like it's a cockpit
3. **Highlight boxes**: Draw attention to CLAUDE.md, apps/, commands/ as you mention them
4. **Terminal flex** (optional): Quick `cd Charlieautomates` → `claude` to show the ritual
5. **Before/after Claude response** (optional): Show Claude asking "what's your tech stack?" vs already knowing it

---

## Key Points

- **Assertive tone** - not "I think" but "this is how it works"
- **Show the deliverable immediately** after hook (the folder structure)
- **Acknowledge the alternative** (separate folders) but land firmly on why this is better
- **Position as personal assistant** - Claude "lives" in this workspace
