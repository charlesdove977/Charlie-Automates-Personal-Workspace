# LinkedIn Post Template: Lessons Learned Listicle

## Why This Works
- Personal experience hook (builds credibility)
- Numbered list format (easy to scan)
- Contrarian framing ("stopped doing X")
- Specific, actionable insights (not generic advice)
- Engagement question at the end (drives comments)

## The Post

I've built 20+ projects with Claude Code last year into 2026. Here are 5 things I stopped doing that changed everything:

1. Stopped writing code myself first

I used to sketch out the structure, then ask Claude to "fill in the gaps." Wrong approach. Now I describe what I want, let Claude architect it, then refine. It sees patterns I miss and catches edge cases before they become bugs.

2. Stopped using vague acceptance criteria

"Make it work" is not a requirement. Neither is "make it production-ready." Now I say: "Add input validation, handle the empty array case, and return a 400 status with this exact error format." Claude delivers exactly what you specify—nothing more, nothing less.

3. Stopped context-switching mid-session

Jumping between unrelated tasks in one session = confused outputs. Now I treat each feature or bug as its own focused session. Clear context, clear results.

4. Stopped ignoring the plan

I used to skip straight to "build it." Now I ask Claude to outline the approach first. 5 minutes of planning saves 2 hours of "wait, that's not what I meant." Complex tasks need a blueprint before construction.

5. Stopped treating errors as failures

When something breaks, I paste the full error and say "diagnose this." Claude doesn't just fix it—it explains why it happened and how to prevent it. Every bug is now a learning loop.

The shift? I stopped using Claude Code like autocomplete and started using it like a technical co-founder who needs clear direction.

What's one habit you've had to unlearn with AI tools?

## Template Structure

**Hook:** [Personal credibility] + [Number] things I stopped doing that changed everything

**Body:** Numbered list with:
- Short headline (what you stopped)
- Before behavior
- After behavior / why it works

**Closer:** Reframe the overall shift

**CTA:** Open-ended question inviting comments

## Adaptation Notes

Replace the specific examples with your own domain:
- Sales: "5 things I stopped doing on discovery calls"
- Marketing: "5 things I stopped doing with ad copy"
- Ops: "5 things I stopped doing with my CRM"

The "stopped doing" frame works because it implies learning through failure, which is relatable and positions you as someone who's been in the trenches.
