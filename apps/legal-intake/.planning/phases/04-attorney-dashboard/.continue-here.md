<current_state>
Phase 4 (Attorney Dashboard) is 100% complete. All 4 plans executed successfully.
The MVP is fully functional and ready for deployment.

User wants to deploy first before continuing to Phase 5.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Phase 4 - Attorney Dashboard (All Complete)**
- 04-01: Authentication (NextAuth.js v5, credentials login)
- 04-02: Dashboard Shell & Case Inbox (sidebar, header, case list with polling)
- 04-03: Case Brief Viewer (7 brief display components, API endpoint)
- 04-04: Accept/Reject Actions (confirmation dialogs, API endpoints, response generation)

**Full MVP Flow Now Works:**
1. Client visits `/{firmSlug}/intake`
2. Uploads documents, fills intake form
3. AI processes and generates case brief
4. Attorney logs in at `/dashboard/login`
5. Views case inbox with fit scores
6. Opens case, sees full AI brief
7. Accepts or rejects with one click
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Immediate:**
- Deploy to Vercel (production)
- Test full flow end-to-end in production

**Future (Phase 5+):**
- Email notifications on reject
- Calendar booking on accept
- Embeddable widget for firm websites
- Firm settings/configuration
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Template-based rejection response (no AI call needed for MVP)
- Reusable ConfirmDialog component for all confirmation modals
- Email sending deferred to Phase 5
- Calendar booking deferred to Phase 5+
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. MVP is ready for deployment.
</blockers>

<context>
The legal intake product is complete for MVP validation. Core value prop works:
attorneys can make informed accept/reject decisions in under 2 minutes.

User's goal is to deploy and validate before adding more features.
Recommended approach: ship → get feedback → iterate.
</context>

<next_action>
When resuming:
1. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel deploy --prod`
2. Run database migrations on production Supabase
3. Create test firm + user via seed endpoint
4. Test full flow end-to-end
5. Share with Haider for validation

Or to continue building: `/gsd:plan-phase 5`
</next_action>
