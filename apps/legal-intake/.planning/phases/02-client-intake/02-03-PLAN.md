<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create intake questionnaire component</name>
  <files>src/components/intake/IntakeForm.tsx, src/app/[firmSlug]/intake/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Create src/components/intake/IntakeForm.tsx:
   - 'use client' component
   - Form fields for client intake:
     * clientName (required) - text input
     * clientEmail (required) - email input with validation
     * clientPhone (optional) - tel input
     * caseType (required) - select dropdown with family law options:
       - Divorce
       - Child Custody
       - Child Support

     * briefDescription (optional) - textarea for case summary (max 1000 chars)
   - Use native HTML form with React state management
   - Inline validation with error messages
   - onSubmit callback prop

2. Create src/app/[firmSlug]/intake/page.tsx:
   - Server component that renders intake page
   - Get firm from parent layout context
   - Compose: IntakeForm + FileDropzone + (disclaimer in next task)
   - Stepped flow: 1) Contact Info → 2) Case Details → 3) Documents → 4) Review & Submit

Styling:
- Professional form layout with clear labels
- Required field indicators
- Zinc colors, firm primaryColor for submit button
- Generous spacing for readability
  </action>
  <verify>Form renders all fields, validation triggers on blur/submit, form state updates correctly</verify>
  <done>IntakeForm collects client info and case details with validation, intake page renders form</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build legal disclaimer component with acceptance</name>
  <files>src/components/intake/LegalDisclaimer.tsx, src/components/intake/IntakeForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Create src/components/intake/LegalDisclaimer.tsx:
   - Display legal disclaimer text in scrollable container (max-height)
   - Disclaimer content (hardcoded for now, will be firm-configurable in Phase 5):
     * "This intake form does not create an attorney-client relationship."
     * "The information you provide will be reviewed by [Firm Name] to determine if they can assist you."
     * "Submitting this form does not guarantee legal representation."
     * "Do not include sensitive information you would not want shared with this law firm."
     * "By submitting, you consent to [Firm Name] reviewing your information and documents."
   - Checkbox: "I have read and understand the above disclaimers" (required)
   - Visual: bordered container, smaller text, professional formatting
   - Export accepted state via callback

2. Update IntakeForm.tsx to include LegalDisclaimer:
   - Add disclaimer before submit button
   - Submit button disabled until disclaimer accepted
   - Validate disclaimer acceptance on form submit

Styling:
- Disclaimer box with zinc-100 background, zinc-300 border
- Scrollable if content exceeds viewport
- Checkbox aligned with label text
- Clear visual indication that disclaimer is required
  </action>
  <verify>Disclaimer displays correctly, checkbox toggles state, submit disabled until accepted</verify>
  <done>LegalDisclaimer component with acceptance checkbox, form validates disclaimer before submit</done>
</task>

</tasks>
